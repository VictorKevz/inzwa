Inzwa Business is the backend for a voice-driven intent intelligence system that turns customer conversations into structured business insights. This Firebase Functions project connects an ElevenLabs voice agent to Google Cloud (Firestore and NLU), exposing HTTP endpoints for real-time product recommendations and post-call transcript processing. Transcripts are analyzed into normalized intents, sentiment, and product signals, then stored in Firestore in a dashboard-friendly schema. The data produced here powers the Inzwa Business dashboard, which visualizes demand, unmet needs, and recommendation performance for merchants.
